# The idea is this: we can have ActiveRecord::Base.connection return an Adapter object (that executes the
# actual SQL queries) and inside that adapter we can redirect all SELECT queries to the read replica instead of
# the main database. This is however slightly more involved than it looks, because if we keep calling
# establish_connection willy-nilly we are going to disconnect from the master DB, connect to the read DB, disconnect
# again and so on.
#
# The right approach for this is to maintain a separate connection pool instad just for connections to the read
# slave. This is exactly what we are doing within AutoReplica.
#
# The setup to make it work is a bit involved. If you want to play with how ActiveRecord uses connections,
# the only actual "official" hook you can use is replacing the connection handler it uses. When a SQL request needs
# to be run AR walks the following dependency chain to arrive at the actual connection:
#
# * SomeRecord.connection calls ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler
# * It then asks the connection handler for a connection for this specific ActiveRecord subclass, or barring that
#   - for the connection for one of it's ancestors, ending with ActiveRecord::Base itself
# * The ConnectionHandler, in turn, asks one of its managed ConnectionPool objects to give it a connection for use.
# * The connection is returned and then the query is ran against it.
#
# This is why the only integration point for this is ++ActiveRecord::Base.connection_handler=++
# To make our trick work, here is what we do:
#
# First we wrap the original ConnectionHandler used by ActiveRecord in our own proxy. That proxy will ask the original
# ConnectionHandler for a connection to use, but it will also maintain it's own ConnectionPool just for the read
# replica connections.
#
# When a connection is returned by the original Handler, it is wrapped into a Adapter together with the
# read connection obtained from the special read pool. That proxy will intercept all of the SQL methods for SELECT
# and redirect them to the read connection instead. All of the other methods (including transactions)
# are still going to be executed on the master database.
#
# Once the block exits, the original connection handler is reassigned to the AR connection_pool.
